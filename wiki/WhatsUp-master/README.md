# WhatsUp
### A Java WhatsApp Client

WhatsUp is - as noted before - a WhatsApp Client written in Java. It's purpose is to let the user write Messages to other people using the WhatsApp Service using a PC instead of a mobile.

The mobilephone-number has to be in the format "ccxxxxx...", so for example: "49178276238746" (if this number really exists, call it). If you're using WhatsApp on your iPhone, the "imei" will be your MAC-Address ("AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"). The username should be... your username.

## I've got no idea for a appropriate title for this, so just deal with this really long thing...
So, actually right now this is a port of https://github.com/venomous0x/WhatsAPI.
